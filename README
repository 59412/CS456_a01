The Assignment is done in C++ programming language, with C++11 standard.

The code is entirely developed on various terminals in student.cs.uwaterloo.ca

In order to run the program, follow these instructions:
1.unzip the .zip file in any directory
2.type in command "make", two new executable files "server" and "client" will appear
3.input "./server.sh <req_code>" in command line on the terminal where you want as a server. Replace <req_code> with any integer that's normal.(not overflowing)
4.input "./client.sh <server_address> <n_port> <req_code> <msg>" in command line
  server_address: you should get this address by running "hostname"(if Linux) on your server terminal (or 127.0.0.1 for local terminal)
  n_port: Once you ran ./server.sh, it will output its n_port number and that is the number you need to connecting to it
  req_code: Must be same as the one you put on ./server.sh, if not, the request will be declined
  msg: The string you want to reverse
After you send the request, the request will appear on server and client will receive the reversed message if no error occurs. Otherwise, check server for error details.
5.you can repeatively send requests to server as long as it's still open

For coding details, please check all comments
For intermeidate value verifications, uncomment some of the printf functions. Their meaning are all commented

Questions:

1.Which machines was the code written on?

2.Compiler?
g++ compiler used on student.cs.uwaterloo.ca environment

3.Files and Executables?

executables: server <req_code>
             client <server_address> <n_port> <req_code> <msg>
files:       server.cpp <req_code>
             client.cpp <server_address> <n_port> <req_code> <msg>
             ./server.sh <req_code>
             ./client.sh <server_address> <n_port> <req_code> <msg>
